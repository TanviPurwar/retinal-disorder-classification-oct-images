# Retinal Disease Classification using Vision Transformer

Created for Major Project in Bachelors

A deep learning model built with a Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture to classify retinal OCT images into three disease categories and normal retinas.

## 🧠 Overview

- Used a dataset of ~81,000 Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) retinal images.
- Classified into four categories: **CNV**, **DME**, **Drusen**, and **Normal**.
- Trained a Vision Transformer for high-accuracy image classification.

## 📈 Results

- **Accuracy Achieved**: **94.5%**

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- Python
- PyTorch
- NumPy, pandas
- Matplotlib for visualization

## 📁 Dataset
